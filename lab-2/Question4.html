          Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed spatulas! (What

          My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite
          dessert is cupcakes, so Cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both
          worlds.
          <br /><br />
          Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, "Sometimes me think what is
          love, and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up
          the last cookie for you." I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes?
          (If so, I don’t think I can ever love ANYONE!)
